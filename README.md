# ProstateCancerDataAnalysis
This repository contains R scripts for comprehensive analysis of prostate cancer data, focusing on androgen levels and correlation analyses. The scripts are designed to facilitate the exploration of how androgen levels affect prostate cancer progression and to identify relationships between various biological variables.

## Overview
The ProstateCancerDataAnalysis project provides tools for:
Analyzing prostate cancer data with a focus on androgen-related variables.
Performing correlation analyses to uncover potential associations between different biological variables.

## Features
## Androgen Analysis:
Load and analyze prostate cancer datasets with androgen-related information.
Perform statistical analyses to explore the relationship between androgen levels and cancer progression.
Generate plots to visualize the effects of androgen levels on various biological endpoints.

## Correlation Analysis:
Load prostate cancer datasets for correlation analysis.
Compute correlation coefficients between selected variables.
Create heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize correlation patterns.

## Installation
Ensure that R is installed on your system and install the necessary packages using the following command in R:

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "corrplot"))

## Usage
Load the Scripts:
Load both prostate_androgen_data.R and correlation_prostate_data.R scripts into your R environment.
Run Androgen Analysis:
Use the prostate_androgen_data.R script to analyze prostate cancer data in relation to androgen levels. Customize the parameters as needed.
Perform Correlation Analysis:
Use the correlation_prostate_data.R script to calculate correlation coefficients between variables of interest. Adjust the parameters to suit your specific research questions.

## Visualize Results:
Utilize the plotting functions in both scripts to visualize the analysis outcomes and correlation patterns.
